        My name is Kassabeh Zakariya, I'm a master degree IT engineer student.

        I really like chess, video games and board games. I have 2 older sisters
        and a little brother with whom I like to play a lot.

        I also have a great passion for communication. I like to learn and teach
        others. For me this is the essence of our society. When I was little, I
        wanted to become a mathematics teacher, but my passion for computers won
        out.
